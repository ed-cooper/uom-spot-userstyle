# University of Manchester SPOT Userstyle

The UI of the [SPOT](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/me/spot/) service, whilst functional, could do with a graphical overhaul.

I've taken vague inspiration from the updated [My Manchester](https://my.manchester.ac.uk/) website, in order to create something that feels at least vaguely consistent with other University services.

## Usage

This style has been designed to work with the Google Chrome [Stylish extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en).

The file [userstyle.css](userstyle.css) can be imported into Stylish, which should cause the custom CSS to be injected exclusively into the SPOT website.
